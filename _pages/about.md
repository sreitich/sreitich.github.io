Howdy! I'm Sam. You'll usually see me online as "Samathan."



I'm a game developer specializing in **gameplay programming** and **tools.** Most of my work is in Unreal Engine, which I've been using for eight years now.



I use this site to share some cool features, techniques, and gameplay systems I think people may find useful or interesting. If you don't want a step-by-step walkthrough, you can always find the full source code from each article on [Unreal Engine's learning site](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/profile/0ProO/Samathan%23tutorials).



Feel free to reach out to me on the Unreal Engine Discord server for help! You can usually find me in the #cpp and #gameplay-ability-system channels.



For any other inquiries, you can reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samreitich/).
